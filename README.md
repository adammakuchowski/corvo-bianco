Corvo-Bianco is a wine online store project built with React using Next.js.

## Description

Corvo-Bianco was created for learning and improving programming skills, providing a responsive interface for easy browsing of diverse wine offerings. It's a practical application of modern web technologies, perfect for gaining experience in web application design. Additionally, in this project, I made an effort to use as few ready-made components from external libraries as possible, aiming to enhance programming skills.

Wine data is fetched from the second part of this project, a dedicated API: https://github.com/adammakuchowski/corvo-bianco-api

### Used technologies

* TS
* JS
* HTML
* CSS
* React
* Next

### Used libraries

* React Icons
* Styled-components
* Material-UI
* Axios
* Moment
* Redux
* Redux-toolkit
* React-scroll

## Getting Started

### Executing program

* Before starting use your package manager: npm or yarn to install all necessary dependencies and packages

* If you're trying to start the project on your computer after cloning reop, you won't have real wine data. To address this, use special mock data in the file: src\features\products\data.ts during fetching data from the API.

```
npm install
```

* If all dependencies are installed successfully, use the command to run the application

```
npm run start
```
